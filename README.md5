This is a game I'm working on creating as a personal project.  I'm using SDL2
for graphics, but everything else is my own C++ code.  At this point, I'm still
building the engine.  I haven't yet bothered naming anything related to it,
hence, the reason why I'm just calling it RPG for now.

I am also using this project to learn Visual Studio.


==DEVELOPMENT NOTES============================================================



(20/03/2018) After beginning work on the map/tiling engine, I realize it would
be better to at least create some part of the actor class(es).

I decided I needed some graphical assets.  A sprite sheet for the main
character, in particular.  So I'm mostly working on drawing right now... which
I'm not very good at.  It'll probably be a while...


(16/03/2018) Changing the state machine implimentation, done.  Also added the
"Line Ending Unifier" plug-in to Visual Studio, so an additional file was
added by it.


(14/03/2018) Although I should have realized it before I even began working on
this project, I recently realized that the way I was handling the state machine
that the game is running inside of was overly complicated when I could have
just used a stack instead.  As a result, I'm having to change quite a bit that
I've already written to utilize the normal program stack frame to manage a
large part the state machine functionality for me...  Live and Learn.  I'm
going to hold of on pushing more updates until I've got these changes working,
which may be a while.
